**Description of website**
  This birthday party planner/RSVP website lets hosts choose a theme, personalize it, and send invites to guests. 
  It keeps party planning organized by collecting RSVPs and offering tools to make the process stress-free.

**TechnicaL specifications**
  The webpage is built using HTML to create forms for collecting user data and tables to display guest lists. 
  Images to create birthday invite templates and html tags like labels, inputs, buttons, dropdown box, checkbox, etc.
  CSS is used for styling, including transitions and flexbox layouts for a responsive design.
  
**What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?**
 Could have planned for a simple application which doesn't involve too many pages.
 
**Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?**
  One of the challenges was obtaining high-quality images that wouldnâ€™t lose resolution when upscaled. 
  Ensuring the images remained sharp and clear at larger sizes required significant effort, as many of the available options became pixelated or blurry when resized. 
  
**What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?**
 If given more time, I would make it more user friendly  by adding serach functionalities and try to optimize the code for the page to load faster.
